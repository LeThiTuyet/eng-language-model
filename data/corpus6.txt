One account claimed that passengers' attempts to retrieve luggage from the overhead lockers prevented others from escaping.

Denis Yevdokimov, the plane's commander, said lightning knocked out radio and electronic guidance systems, forcing pilots to fly manually.

Tatyana Kasatkina, a stewardess, said: "We took off and flew into a cloud, it was hailing heavily. At that moment there was a bang, this kind of flash, like electricity. It all happened very quickly."

The Flightradar24 tracking service showed that the plane had circled twice over Moscow before making an emergency landing after just under 30 minutes in the air.

The plane's under-carriage gave way on impact and its engines caught fire.

Interfax cited a source as saying the plane had only succeeded making an emergency landing on the second attempt and that some of the aircraft's systems had then failed.

The emergency landing was so hard that debris had found its way into the engines, sparking a fire that swiftly engulfed the rear of the fuselage, the same source said.

Russian news agencies reported that the plane had been produced in 2017 and had been serviced as recently as April this year.

By last night, more than 4,000 people had signed an online petition calling for Russia to stop flying Superjets following eight safety incidents in the past year.

But the transport minister said he saw no reason to stop Superjet flights.

Mexico's Interjet grounded 15 of its 22 Superjets this year, complaining that the plane's engine, produced by a joint venture between French and Russian companies, needed to be fixed too often.
