Michael Cohen, US President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, took a parting shot at his former boss - denouncing "xenophobia, injustice and lies" - before reporting to a federal prison yesterday to begin a three-year sentence.

Cohen, who once vowed to "take a bullet" for Mr Trump but now calls him a "con man", arrived at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, New York, about 110km northwest of New York City, to serve his sentence for arranging hush payments to two women who said they had sexual encounters with Mr Trump and for lying to Congress.

Before being driven to the facility, Cohen (52) made brief remarks to a crush of reporters gathered outside his Manhattan apartment building.

"I hope that when I rejoin my family and friends that the country will be in a place without xenophobia, injustice and lies at the helm of our country," Cohen said. "There still remains much to be told, and I look forward to the day that I can share the truth."

It completes a stunning fall for the native of Long Island whose career was tethered to Mr Trump as he evolved from real estate developer to TV personality to politician. For more than a decade, Cohen served as Trump's lawyer and self-described "fixer".

The relationship began to sour after FBI agents raided Cohen's office in April 2018 as part of an investigation that grew out of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election. The information gathered in the raids contributed to a series of criminal charges against Cohen that caused his dramatic split with Trump.
